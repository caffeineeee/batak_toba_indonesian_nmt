# Batak Toba language-Indonesian machine translation with transfer learning using No Language Left Behind

This repository contains the implementation of a machine translation model based on the research paper [COMING SOONðŸ¤ž]. The model architecture and training procedure are described in detail in the provided Jupyter Notebook file.

## Requirements

- Transformers 4.34.1
- Pytorch 2.1.0+cu118
- Datasets 2.13.1
- Tokenizers 0.14.1

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/caffeineeee/batak_toba_indonesian_nmt.git
cd batak_toba_indonesian_nmt
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `batak_toba_indonesian_nmt.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook batak_toba_indonesian_nmt.ipynb
```

Alternatively, you can run it using **Google Colab**. For improved training speed, adjust the runtime type to **T4 GPU or higher**.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the machine translation model, evaluate its performance, and experiment with different parameters.
